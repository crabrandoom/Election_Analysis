ELECTION ANALYSIS README

e tasks that need to be completed for the election audit, and discuss the information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Similarly, a programmer or analyst may write the steps to count the votes of an election like this:

Open the data file.
Write down the names of all the candidates.
Add a vote count for each candidate.
Get the total votes for each candidate.
Get the total votes cast for the election.
